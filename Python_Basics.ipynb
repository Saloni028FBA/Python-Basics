        "  - Python is a programming language, which is a set of instructions that instruct a computer how to perform a tasks.\n",
        "  - Python as a programming language helps communicating with the machine as a machine is incable of understanding human language, converting human language in bits [0,1] which can be understood by the machine.  \n",

        "   - **Reasons why Python is popular:**\n",
        "\n",
        "    a) **Python is versatile** in nature because it can used across different domain without major modification runs on windows, macOS and even mobile phones making it go to language for different environments.\n",
        "\n",
        "    b) **Python is scaleable** in nature as it can handle small as well as enterprise level systems integarting with high performance language like C, C++ making it more powerful for high and optimize performance.\n",

        "    c) **Python is well know for its simplicity**, easy to learn and readable syntax well suited for beginner.\n",
        "\n",
        "    d) **Rich ecosystem of libraries** having vast, diverse and coninously growing libraries suitable for any domain like finance,AI,web development which help developer saves time and building solutions by using the well written codes rather than actually creating from scratch.\n",
        "\n",
        "    e) **Strong community support**, Python has strong and active communtity which means a huge number of developers community which provides better learning resources,continous improvement and support for beginner as well as professional players.\n",
